how do you utilize this tool? - jak korzystać z tego narzędzia? 
we must utilize all the tools at our disposal
as a child, Angela was abandoned by her mother
the captain gave the order to abandon |əˈbændən| ship
that house was abandoned |əˈbændənd| years ago
I don't think he's going to abandon his friend in trouble - porzucić/zostawić
she refused to see him - odmówiła w 
dismiss your fear - uwolnij się od?
done successfully. no issues found
I gave him my name
I'm basically happy with the default dark theme, but would like comments in code to stand out more. - odroznic sie
distributed as regular order in the mid of the current quarter - wydawana
you will receive the link for current quarter order soon
loading of the card is done at beginning of the second month of the quarter
cards can be used not only in all bookstores 
but also to buy tickets for all the cultural events 
which take place in cinemas, theatres, operas and museums as well as to pay - odbywają się
for the entrance to the sport centres such as Aquapark, etc
Each person employed at the Company on the basis of an employment contract 
who is entitled to use the Fund?
Looks good to me, but someone else must approve - potwierdzić
due to the size of our local society we would like to offer you 3 options for joining us at hotel
cinema codes are sent via e-mail at the beginning of the second month of the quarter
these cards are distributed just before the beginning of the quarter
please don’t forget to place your order before the deadline
Dear newcomers, please find the link to the short presentation 
Then use the link received on your mailbox and fill the form. You can fill the form only once!
after the deadline links still be active and order can be done, but the sport cards cannot be ordered for November timeframe
then this line is considered as a comment and is ignored before interpreted
our mother's illness concerns us
this file causes the following build behavior
exclude files and directories whose names start with temp in any immediate subdirectory of the root
exclude files and directories starting with temp from any subdirectory that is two levels below the root
Lines that are blank after preprocessing are ignored
Lines starting with ! (exclamation mark) can be used to make exceptions to exclusions
all markdown files except README.md are excluded from the context
ARG is the only instruction that may precede FROM in the Dockerfile - poprzedzać
if you omit either of them, the builder assumes a latest tag by default
to achieve this, specify * as the first pattern, followed by one or more ! exception patterns
the decision was consistent with the company's policy - zgodnie z 
is typically used to address issues with variable names with no whitespace
this helps to avoid unnecessarily sending large or sensitive files and directories to the daemon
the FROM instruction specifies the Parent Image from which you are building
line continuation characters are not supported in comments
therefore, all parser directives must be at the very top of a Dockerfile
treated as a comment due to appearing after a builder instruction
if not specified, the default escape character is \ (backslash)
note that regardless of whether the escape parser directive is included in a Dockerfile
the escape character is used both to escape characters in a line, and to escape a newline
Docker treats lines that begin with # as a comment, unless the line is a valid parser directive. 
A # marker anywhere else in a line is treated as an argument. 
Docker will re-use the cache, to accelerate the docker build process significantly.
The problem concerns |kənˈsɝːnz| us all.
The Docker daemon runs the instructions in the Dockerfile one-by-one
as it causes the build to transfer the entire contents of your hard drive to the Docker daemon
her ill health concerns me.
it performs a preliminary validation of the Dockerfile and returns an error if the syntax is incorrect
if a download fails due to a network problem, it will keep retrying until the whole file has been retrieved
is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from the Web
Long options are more convenient to remember, but take time to type
you may freely mix different option styles
If you use -c on a non-empty file, and the server does not support continued downloading ...
the space between the option accepting an argument and the argument may be omitted
the same happens when the file is smaller on the server than locally
This behavior can be desirable (porządany) in certain cases
another instance where you'll get a garbled file if you try to use -c is if you have a lame HTTP proxy
Server support for continued download is required, otherwise --start-pos cannot help
Wget will assume that it is the first portion of the remote file
if there is a file named ls-lR.Z in the current directory
Wget will restart the download from scratch and overwrite the existing file entirely
Copy one of the examples below into your repository and name it Jenkinsfile
Provide a name for your new item
click the Add Source button, choose the type of repository you want to use and fill in the details.
Click the Save button and watch your first Pipeline run!
Think of a "step" like a single command which performs a single action
when a step succeeds it moves onto the next step - powiódł się 
all the steps in the Pipeline have successfully completed
when a step fails to execute correctly the Pipeline will fail
and then waits for up to (do) 3 minutes for the script to execute
If the health check script does not complete in 3 minutes, the Pipeline will be marked as having failed
we can compose these steps together - komponować
These actions can be performed in the post section.
This will run only if failed
under the hood - pod maską
Underneath the hood, there are a few things agent causes to happen - pod maską?
as soon as an executor is available, the steps will begin to execute
for this tour we will only focus on
his approach allows you to use practically any tool which can be packaged in a Docker container
When the Pipeline executes, Jenkins will automatically start the specified container 
and execute the defined steps within it
most people don’t want to sift through thousands of lines of console output to find information about failing tests
A Pipeline that has failing tests will be marked as "UNSTABLE", 
That is distinct from the "FAILED" state, denoted by red. - to się odróznia od
it is often useful to grab built artifacts from Jenkins
This is easily done with the archiveArtifacts step, as is demonstrated in the example below
we’ll talk about how to tell those members of the team what’s been happening in our Pipeline
since the post section of a Pipeline is guaranteed to run at the end of a Pipeline’s execution
