lastly, you can also delete images that you no longer need by running
You can think of the registry as a directory of all available Docker images
The first thing we're going to look at is how we can run a dead-simple static website
since our application is written in Python, the base image we're going to use will be Python 3
!since the image doesn't exist locally, the client will first fetch the image from the registry and then run the image
Okay now that the server is running, how to see the website? What port is it running on?
And more importantly, how do we access the container directly from our host machine? Hit Ctrl+C to stop the container.
the client is not exposing any ports so we need to re-run the docker to publish ports
and asked the Docker client to run a container based on that image
it's time to create our own
As mentioned above, all user images are based on a base image
How are we going to do that?
It's a simple way to automate the image creation process
The best part is that - najlepsze jest to że
This means you don't really have to learn new syntax to create your own dockerfiles.
If everything went well, your image should be ready
Run docker images and see if your image shows.
Head over to the URL with port 8888, where your app should be live.
What good is an application that can't be shared with friends, right? 
There are many different Docker registries you can use (you can even host your own).
Provide the same credentials that you used for logging into Docker Hub.
Once that is done, you can view your image on Docker Hub
One thing that I'd like to clarify before we go ahead is that ...
If you don’t want to preface the docker command with sudo, create a Unix group called docker
The most memorable command to list all groups a user is a member of is the groups command
we recommend you keep the default key name unless you have a reason to change it.
