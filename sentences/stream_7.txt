this chapter demonstrates how to manipulate directories and files
specify an absolute path to create a directory
this command extracts the program name from the path
this command extracts the parent directory of your program
type this command to display the contents of a directory
you can create a new directory within a current directory
directories can be removed in the shell using the 'rmdir' command
this takes the directory name as its argument 
and it will instantly remove an empty directory
it will simply warn you that the directory is not empty if it contains any files
when all files have been deleted it asks if you want to delete the directory
enter this command to remove the directory that you have just created
you'll see a warning if you try to remove this file
reply 'yes' to each question
the directory is now completely empty
an output is describing what is happening
if a directory contains nothing you will miss ...
you can use the rm command with just a -r option to instantly delete a directory
use with care
this command lets you easily move files around your filesystem
this command requires |riˈkwaɪərz| two arguments
it is a name of the file to be moved
it is a destination to which it should be moved
the file is no longer in your home directory. it moved
interestingly  |ˈɪntrəstɪŋli|, this command can also be used to rename a file
type it to confirm the file has been renamed
this command will overwrite a file without any warning, by default
if you wish to copy, rather than move, a file to a new location ...
This command can accept one or more files to be copied as its arguments
the * wildcard can also be used to delete all files in a directory
type command to copy the file in the Documents directory to your home directory
a copy of the file is now in both directories
can you confirm that both directories contain that file?
the 'rm' command can be used to delete one or more files
the semi-colon ; character allows two commands to be issued on the same line
The wildcard * should be used with caution
so ... you may inadvertently (nieumyślnie) remove hidden files
text contained within a plain text file can be displayed in the Terminal screen
use 'cat' (concatenate) command to display a simple text
issue the command 'cat' to display a contents of a file
the full path address of the file must be specified
a link to any file can be created by specifying the target filename and a link filename
a link file has been created
display text contents via the link
links are created as individual files that are not automatically deleted
an another link file has been created alongside the text file
there are soft and hard links
there is a difference between hard and soft links
a hard link will continue to point to the data when the original file is removed
you can use 'readlink' to identify a missing target file
the 'stat' command that lists every important attribute of the file
the 'file' command reports what type of file a file is
the -n option will add line numbers to the output for clarity
type it to discover that file’s line count, word count, and byte count
the date format required for the 'touch' command can vary on different systems
use the command 'man touch' to check the manual page for details
The Bash shell provides several ways to compare two files
You can check to see if two files are identical with the 'cmp' command
If they are indeed identical the command reports nothing
if they differ it reports the location of the first difference
there are lines found in the second file, but not the first
the 'cmp' command can also be used to compare binary files - such as image files
this line is common to both files
It can also be used to compare two directories to reveal unique files
the user can ensure that a downloaded file is intact (nienaruszony)
The 'md5sum' command produces a 32-byte checksum for the file specified as its argument
you can discover more about the diff command output using man diff
locating a file on your system can be achieved  using the find command
this command has over 50 possible options
it is a point from which to begin searching
type it to seek all files in your home directory whose names begin with 'hello'
add a -L option to also report the location of any softlinks to the files
you can specify -type d to the find command to seek directories
how to unhide all columns?
removal effort? - usunięcie, wysiłek
would it be possible to add it?
I agree that we should use a separate branch 
it copies the sequence of characters



She's taking her time making up the reasons - rozważnię, nie spiesze się
To justify all the hurt inside, guess she knows
From the smiles and the look in their eyes
Everyone's got a theory about the bitter one, they're saying
Mama never loved her much and
Daddy never keeps in touch - być w kontakcie
That's why she shies away from human affection, but - odsuwać się / sympatia
Somewhere in a private place
She packs her bags for outer space
And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot to come
And she'll say to him (she's saying)
I would fly you to the moon and back
If you'll be, if you'll be my baby
I've got a ticket for a world where we belong
So would you be my baby?
She can't remember a time when she felt needed
If love was red then she was color-blind
All her friends, they've been tried for treason - zdrada
been tried for - sprawdzić pod kontem
And crimes that were never defined
She's saying, love is like a barren (bezpłone) place
And reaching out for human faith is - sięgać po
Is like a journey I just don't have a map for - podróż do której
So baby gonna take a dive and push the shift to overdrive
Send a signal that she's hanging all her hopes on the stars
What a pleasant dream (just saying)
I would fly you to the moon and back
If you'll be, if you'll be my baby
I've got a ticket for a world where we belong
So would you be my baby?
