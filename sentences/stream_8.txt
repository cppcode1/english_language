please, sit down. she sat down
come in. make yourself at home
she looked tired
can you tell me the way to the town centre?
is it larger or smaller?
sorry, say that again - powiedź to raz jeszcze
she doesn't like beetroot. 
neither do I - ja też
this lesson is more interesting than first one
she can't speak fluently
please speak a little slower
how fat is it from here?
she won't speak. she is in a bad mood
neither ... nor - ani ... ani ...
neither me nor she speaks English
prayer: bless us and keep us all alive
there are eight of us for supper
keep quiet in the library
pullover, jumper, sweter
she goes downstairs
tell us the truth
I'll go if you'll come with me
you will learn quicker if you will read a lesson every day
shall we take a taxi?
she needs me
give me that wallet. it's mine!
